                        To continue the journey ahead I had to stop thinking about saving the world from what I couldn't even point a finger on and just make a difference. I was already making a difference and doing well for myself as a human being IRL but this time I needed to take an ecosystemic approach. To make a difference I needed money and lots of it. Something everyone struggles with even if you maintain a luxurious lifestyle. Long before the blockchain all i could ever do is think about ways and ideas one can use or capitalize on. Who isn't right? If only one had the money of course. Come on, we've all had daydreams as such before. Hopefully good ones. If not, you will now because you've gotten this far. If you've been reading since the journey began and haven't taken a break I'd suggest you take one as it only gets more celestial from here on.
                        <br><br>
                        Most of us came to the blockchain in seek of money primarily. Not me, but if I could attain that generational wealth and financial freedom in the process of making a difference on a global scale; then I'd blissfully make this my life's work and just keep building. To capitalize on a patent/invent something new, start my own business, I could go on but were all possibilities layed out in my life's path before ever embarking on this journey. I'd have to give up if not in/definitely pause this for the blockchain. I was comfortable in life, with life, already lving my life to the fullest. Should I do more than enough? Should I give this up for the Blockchain? Would it be for the greater good? Can I still do this and venture down the blockchain path? All these questions bothered me as I educated myself on blockchain technology and potential possibilities. 
                        <br><br>
                        The answer was yes but it would come at a cost. I'd have to embark on my IRL possibilities later on in life even if I found a way to incorporate it within my long to be project. Where to start? Joining NFT communities obviously but I needed to have more intentions before I decided on which. To create value and build upon that value I'd need to be a blue chip of a project but that name was taken IRL long before my time hence the authenticity of word itself but a dam good name. Blue chip with an s was probably already taken as its too good of a name to market on and probably taken by the same people that attained bluechip itself. Sheeesh! That's what i would do. How about bluechip with a z? Eureka! How on God's earth is this not taken? I was abel to buy the ETH X domain and It'd be w.e I make of it after that. It was a dam great feeling to be early in the game. I did just that. The web2 domain was also available but I could care less as web3 was my focus.
                        <br><br>
                        I'll create my own world and as community grows, I'll add collections that will make RW impacts but won't call it charity or non proffit or register it as such. The less RW buisness association the better. Future actions will show for itself as we impact the world positively on a Global scale. A ecosystem can't fail if other entities are supporting one another from within therefore, I'd need to plan collections accordingly. It'll all come to me on my Celestial Journey however, stepping out as a founder, I'd need to have a collection of my own or something of the sort to start with. It had to be a bluechip collection to stand up to a reputable stature. 
                        <br><br>
                        Jack dorsey went viral despite the money he made when he minted his own tweet. Why did no one see or understand the importance of this? He did the closest thing to capturing a moment in time and preserving it on the blockchain where it would remain forever. That's what I'll do. Make a collection of tweets and build on it's value before I even release for sale. I'll come up with a twist if need be later on down the road. My mind took off...
                        <br><br>
                        ...I needed something more. Like any structure I needed to start with foundation. Something to reflect this and original too. Something everyone can agree upon and see common ground no matter our differences no religion or politics. Love was the answer. Love and the universe. No one can argue with the universe as no one knows enough to even do so hence the unknown. Note, we keep our ecosystem and communities within as such. It's like the universe carved out the foundation and tied it to my life long before the blockchain. How Celestial is that? 
                        <br><br>
                        My greatest act of love was performed within the universe on August 21st 2017 at 11:11am in Los Angeles California, Lake Hollywood Dr. At Burbank Peak, the highest peak at the end of Griffith Park. It was a celestial event as we were in the midst of experiencing a total solar eclipse. Not just any astronomical event but rather something that hadn't taken place almost a century before. After all, I'll eventually be going into buisness and only the universe would know the sacrifices for love I'd have to make down this road. I'll bring back "total eclipse of the heart" "teoth" in the process and decide if I'll sell/auction any during/long after I drop collections for the ecosystem. I had a basis to go on. The universe and humanity would guide me through the rest. I'll have a platform for CelestialCommunity and one for BlueChipz.X. Most collections will be for the CelestialCommunity so I'll place "Moments in Time" as their 1st to push growth and establish value. The BlueChipz part will have the photo collection and a major drop to support the CelestialCommunity despite ecosystem of collections supporting one another. I'll create fail safes for fail safes making failure not an option. Security at it's finest and prosperity overall.
                        <br><br>
                        There is so much one could add to an ecosystem as you're actually creating a world of your own in the process. I preferred to start putting pen to paper after I joined a community and see for myself how different people are in the space compared to real life like I've been told via doing my own research. Let's go. I'd have to give up time on FB (my only social media by choice) and create a personality out of love and mysteries of the universe. Content and material too easy as FB already caters algo around these things as if I was made for this role or should need any to start/keep constant/relative. Are you keeping up? Can you feel/understand the thought process as something forms from nothingness? Good, now break or let's keep going.
                        <br><br>
                        I had to bear in mind being positive at all or most of the time as I'm entering as an unworldly being and not as human. Something I can create a storyline for down the line and even mimic it to somewhat of an semi/autobiography if I choose to. So many possibilities and so early. Art at it's finest. It would all come to me when/if necessary in time. Infact, since I'll be the 1st of my kind to so something of this magnitude/complexity, I'll give myself a new profession in the name. What type of artists you may ask? A Blauartist. We'll also build upon that in the process. 
                        <br><br>
                        In about half a year or less we'd be in another celestial moment in time making for a perfect date entry to the world, 2/22/2022 and to give it that Jack Dorsey 1st tweet value. I had to set up my collections on opensea before I post my 1st tweet. I also did it at 2:22am to give it even more of a value as it should be. With this we can say not only time is money but timing is as well.
                        <br><br>
                        The year started with a devastated blow IRL that would take me years to recover but I stuck to the plan. Prepared my collection, joined my 1st NFT community and posted my 1st tweet as per the mission at hand. I'm not one for attention and drama but I'm no stranger to it either hence why I enjoy my own company above all. People are gonna be people and I can't be more than that no matter how I try to be perceived online or in the future. It's just facts. To be more, I need to show but 1st, I need to become one with the environment as a whole. I'll make the most of my Celestial Journey as it caters to my directed path and be cautious on selling out or blind traps along the way. I'd need to be mean if I need to and that was what I've inevitably dread. That's where I came up with the saying "It is what it is as... it is."
                        <br><br>
                        The 1st community I joined was a veteran led community that excelled beyond expectations becuse of it's founder and comunity as a result. He was indeed a celestial beast. The project aimed to help veterans IRL causing RW impact via the blockchain. Being a veteran myself, I found it the best place to socialize as I familiarize myself with humans because any veteran will tell you, we'd call you civilians outside the service for that very reason. We've become something more than human by experiencing a differnt level of diversity and working under the same roof to accomplish the same mission set before us. Compassion, love, hate, emotions one has no words to describe are experienced amongst our brothers and sisters at arms. Broken to be built back up to be broken again. A few pass through it well, most (I'd argue all) are wounded and many don't make it. It makes for even the few that do see it through, affected by the tragedies of the/our past. Thus, the ecosystem upholds the same "Army Values" aswell.
                        <br><br>
                        As time went on I decided to venture more outside my comfort zone to experience the space for what it truly was. I learnt that like we do, civilians, they too see us and even treat us on another level/tier (pros & cons) within said space. Cons that would eventually wither with time as communities adapt to become prosperous and grow together. A harmonic necessity needed for the culture.
                        <br><br>
                        I later joined an Evil Ape community with whos' art loured me into the 1st place. Did I break away from my rule of sticking to my ecosystem's plan? I'm love and evil is hate. I could make it work If need be. After all, I wasn't looking to collab with every project I set foot in. However, I did like the good and evil take on things for the ecosystem despite being overall good on the road to greatness. What about being so bad that it's good? That's spicy! Other possibilities flooded my mind but for now, we'll enjoy the ride. I could go on and on about communities I've joined. How I became a FUC boy; how I stumbled upon free education to the blockchain; adventures and my experiences within. Just know that these core communities molded me into holding my own again before the universe took me back outside. 
                        <br><br>
                        As my Celestial Journey continued, one project transformed astronomically the other 3 eventually seest to exist. The differnt people (communities) and experiences I came across during my entire celestial journey molded me into Cel3stial Chipz you see present day. As per my character, I've lived seven lives and well, the blockchain is forever so I can't see anymore than the last for me. Back to outside. During early on my Celestial Journey I stumbled upon the PoNY project but had pushed them to the side because on NY. That's right. The very place I also reside. Reason being was that I came to this space for an interplanetary reach and even though, I was ignorant to them holding RW events and seeing NY in the name perceived it as such. I was in the infancy of development for my self and my project. I wasn't ready to be outside as Chipz. I needed to be comforable in this realm, developed with experience or somewhat prepared, worse case scenario. Eventually, I gave into urge of what if NY. What if it was here all along but you had to step out and do you? Sure enough, the universe didn't disappoint. It was NY and I did need that celestial journey before, if I should eventually get out IRL. One thing led to another and boom, I joined their community. They had a solid community, did phases which gave me that ecosystem comfort/vibe and had recently restructured to establish a fresh journey ahead. 
                        <br><br>
                        Great! I came it at new beginnings but didn't keep up as one should. Time went on and from information within the discord, I saw that I missed a few IRL events. It was great to know that outside existed evolving into this character and all. As I became a bit more active in community chat I decided to pop out and catch these guys live. I scheduled a day trip to the city with my empress and we ended it with a IRL PoNY blockchain event. The day was grand the night was stellar! We went to the event and it was a feature of other IRL projects (some had nothing to do with the blockchain) as a whole. The team pulled off an awesome presentation I caught some people with their jaws wide open. It was glorious to see people IRL leaning into blockchain possibilities and marveled by the PoNY's journey thus far. The only bad outcome of that entire experience was remembering saying good bye to Jim/Smartz outside in front of the food truck saying I'm about to try a chopped cheese rn. Don't ask how or why but I didn't try it until 2025.
                        <br><br>
                        I became more involved with the community there after, collected a few NFTs and continued on my Celestial Journey. I never treated them as my main or home project but if I were to choose or have the ability to bless any, it'd be them hands down. In 2022 I started this journey. 2023 I went dormant and decided towards the last quarter of that year that Bluechipz.X was too much for me to handle without losing everything IRL to stay relevant. I'd show up to projects as a community member and not as a founder instead but also be be less active as a result. I spent the time venturing into degen options and friends, making money and seeking money opportunities for myself. That's other stories for another time.
                        PoNY went through their ups and downs during this time as well. I watched them celebrate and pushed through but I stayed away. I was crushed to be nothing and disappointed in another great project who's founder became his own downfall due to who he was as an individual. To top it off, he really did damage the PoNY's but it was nothing that they wouldn't rise above to become even stronger as a community. 
                        <br><br>
                        2024 was a completely dormant year for me until, close to 4th Quarter when the founder of the 7th District told me that he wanted to bring our work for the country to the blockchain. I wasn't going to help him achieve this on the hopes that community would remain active to thrive. It's not what I planned for BlueChipz.X so why would I do less for the country I grew up in? I explained our chances of succeeding as a solo project and discouraged him from going through with it. Little did I know, he had already started a community with talented artists via WhatsApp that were open to bring this to light. I couldn't say no and crush hope that came from a place where people seek little to none. My only way to secure their prosperity was to start up BlueChipz.X again and add them to the ecosystem. I explained to him and that we'll make "the 7th district" our main focus while expanding the dormant ecosystem within. The goal was to get them established via music then they could build on more of their own as their own miniature version of BlueChipz.X to maintain themselves from within. They'd still be a part of the ecosystem but not dependent like the other sectors would be.
                        There was no need to be as active on X as we'd build in silence and I wanted to focus on one thing 1st. I would capitalize off aiding the 7th District onto the blockchain and use funds to pay developers to solidify standings within the BlueChipz.X ecosystem. The universe begged to differ.
