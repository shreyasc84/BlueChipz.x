                    <p class="text-gray-300">Born in Brooklyn, grew up in the country of Belize, Residing in NY, I've found a way to make a global positive impact on this little blue dot within this vast space and time of the universe. As a Millennial raised by grandparent in a third world (once British colony) country, I'd say that wisdom, diversity, and life's path has been generous to me thus far. Born in the late 80's I got to experience being raised like a generation before while friends and families were on a different level of upbringing with time. On the last month of my 18th year, I came the united states to reside permanently. I had come to finish up my chemistry degree and start a new life from the one I once known. Not a stranger to America, I journeyed onto a career of food science, quality, and compliance while serving 10 years as an Army Reservist (simultaneously).<br><br>
If I've learnt anything thus far I'd say its that when you can find the good or a justifiable reason to make meaning out of any good or bad obstacle life throws your way, then can you truly win at life. Not riches or fame or being ahead in the rat race game. With that said, let me enlighten you on the events that shaped BlueChipz.X to be. 
<br><br>
While the world panicked around us as we spiraled down to reset mode in 2020, I took control of where I was, given my resources/knowledge and capabilities at the time. It was selfish of me to think on capitalizing/turning this negative to my favor but looking back, it was merely the fight or flight within me as I was on the path to building on a family of my own in that near future. The world came to a pause, I stopped working for a month and it was back to that hustle and bustle NYC life for me.
With FB being my only social media of choice, I used it as a source of news and education for the things that I loved. Longing to give back or help out/the world in some way, I came across a non proffit organization looking to do just that for themselves and others around them. Not just any organization, but one based in my home town. Located on the west side as the largest District in Belize. I later became co-founder of that organization. Progress Cayo. The 7th District. I loaded up on stocks, crypto and learnt the basics on reading candles within this timeframe. 
<br><br>
As I was learning to read candels from an app on Google playstore, I found myself on YouTube as said app was eventually disabled. I saw suggestion for NTFs as I searched away from candel reading and into cryptocurrency. Opened a clip of Gary Vee explaining what NFTs are and how lucrative it can be not to mention lucrative in the form of endless possibilities and transforming the future of the world as we know it. It blew my mind as where else of a better position can one be when celebrities/politicians/entrepreneurs and the entire world needs to start at ground zero to make something for themselves/within. Equal playing ground only capable becuse of this horrendous pandemic and the existence of the blockchain.
<br><br>
I remember clearly how Gary Vee touched my soul and gave me that spark of an Idea by saying that he hopes to in that same video. He was explaining NFTs and giving examples of RW usages like tickets to a baseball game (tokengate) and how it will eventually be apart of our daily lives whether we're ready for it or not. He later went onto saying that he's not out here doing all this and trying to convince the world that NFTs and blockchain is the future but hopes his video sparks interest and speaks to that random kid from Brooklyn or Queens that could one day possibly change this ever evolving world.
Immediately my mind snapped to change/power/control/equal opportunity then thought, if one could wield such power via the blockchain why not save the world? But from what and how when all of man gives into manipulation and greed as far as having great power and anyone knows. Is it just in our nature to stray or be killed by one another to wield/stop/alter it? Not a kid from Brooklyn but was born there so why not me? He didn't mean literally, he meant anyone on earth and his words did just that. Made me comfortable enough to see it as something I could turn into a positive not just for me but others around me as well. If the NFT and Blockchain world was so lucrative, why aren't people working together on this and everyone is still out for themselves. I had failed to realize that as the world restarted and people started to see the opportunities for a fresh start, it was only human to be selfish about it as one seeks liberation in life. This was advantageous yet dangerous for me. The phrase pros and cons popped in my head as I thought about the possible journey I would later take.</p>
