            About Founder
        </h1>
        <p>
            <div class="container mx-auto px-4 py-16 text-center">
                <div class="clay-card p-4">
                    <div class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-5 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-600 rounded-lg mb-4"></div>
                    <p class="text-gray-300">Born in Brooklyn and raised in the country of Belize, I now reside in New York, where I strive to make a positive, global impact on this little blue dot within the vastness of space and time. As a Millennial raised by my grandparents in a third-world country — a once British colony — I consider myself fortunate to have been shaped by wisdom, diversity, and life’s unpredictable journey. Born in the late ‘80s, my upbringing felt more aligned with a generation before my time, while friends and family experienced life through a different lens. In the final month of my 18th year, I moved to the United States permanently, determined to finish my chemistry degree and build a new life from the one I once knew. Though not a stranger to America, I embarked on a career in food science, quality, and compliance, while also serving 10 years as an Army Reservist. If life has taught me one valuable lesson, it’s this: true success isn’t about riches, fame, or winning the rat race. It’s about finding meaning — even in the hardest moments — and turning obstacles into opportunities. This belief laid the foundation for BlueChipz.X. When the world spiraled into uncertainty in 2020, I chose to take control of my circumstances, leaning on my skills, resources, and determination. At the time, it felt selfish to think of capitalizing on such global turmoil, but looking back, it was simply survival — the fight-or-flight instinct kicking in as I prepared to build a future for my own family. The world hit pause; I stopped working for a month and soon returned to the relentless hustle of NYC life. With Facebook as my only social media outlet, I used it as a source for news and education on topics I cared about. Fueled by a desire to give back, I discovered a non-profit organization dedicated to helping others — not just any organization, but one based in my hometown on the west side of Belize, in the country’s largest district. I later became co-founder of that organization: Progress Cayo, the 7th District. During this time, I also immersed myself in stocks, crypto, and the fundamentals of reading candlestick charts. When an app I was using was disabled, I turned to YouTube for learning. While exploring cryptocurrency content, I stumbled across a video about NFTs. It featured Gary Vee, passionately explaining NFTs and their future impact — from token-gated access to events like baseball games to how blockchain would inevitably integrate into our daily lives. His words struck a deep chord with me. He said he wasn’t trying to convince the world that NFTs and blockchain were the future — he just hoped his words would inspire some random kid from Brooklyn or Queens who might one day change the world. Although I wasn’t a kid from Brooklyn anymore, I was born there. Why not me? His message wasn’t literal; it was universal. And it gave me the clarity to see this as more than an opportunity for personal gain — but as a way to make a meaningful impact for others, too. That moment sparked a thought: If blockchain can offer such power and opportunity, why not use it for good? But from what, and how, when human nature often leans toward manipulation and greed? Is it possible to harness such innovation for positive change without falling into the same traps of power and corruption? I realized I wasn’t alone. As the world reset, people sought fresh starts — but naturally, most looked out for themselves. It’s human nature. This truth was both a risk and an advantage for someone like me. The phrase “pros and cons” echoed in my mind as I reflected on the path ahead. BlueChipz.X was born from this journey — from reflection, resilience, and the belief that even in uncertainty, we can create something that lifts not just ourselves but others along the way.</p>
