                        In 2024 During the time that I'd already made up my mind to stay dormant with BlueChipz.X, I caught a random post on my news feed showing Quakey coin. Tied to a NY crypto exchange that's been cooking about a decade before the 2022 hype -the start of my Celestial Journey. Being in degen mode at the time, I immediately looked at marketcap and hloders/distributions. I could care less about liquidity as the lower the better to buy in and a no brainer if you're talking about a NY crypto exchange. A 1st of it's kind! Later on Quakey became involved with various similar communities via spaces on X like duckset and eventually PoNY via Chopped Cheese. They grew faster than I could have imagined. They were moving fast as a community -that NY minute grind as I found myself silently rooting for them. 
                        <br><br>
                        So 2024 came, the founder of the 7th District wants to revive the project; I've made up my mind that BlueChipz.X will start up again in support of this; as a result, I started becoming more active on X; then Violetta Zironi announces that she's coming to NY to perform via well known web3 communities like PoNY and now Quakey. You see how Art unites what should be and shall be? Let me elaborate:
                        I can't pinpoint the moment in time I came across Violetta's harmonic voice but I pointed it out to my wife and said, this girl is going to melt faces and she's already on the Blockchain IRL and the entire planet's gonna know who she is. Or something like that. Haha. My wife brushed it off and started shit talking the blockchain and my ventures within it. I said "When she does, not if. When she does, we're going to see her live when she comes to NY." She laughed it off but agreed as we both enjoyed her music. Well guess what? One of her songs later sold for 1BTC (63k to 67k at the time) and she was coming to NY to perform. LFG!
                        <br><br>
                        It was the eve of Christmas eve. Chipz is stepping back outside. The misses couldn't make it due to day, time and lil Chipz. I was going to make the most out of it for the both of us. The event took place at the Bowery Electric NYC. It was glorious to actually listen and watch her perform live than listening to her recorded songs. You'd have to experience it yourself to understand. I had the honor of meeting her, what breath taking beauty and charm personality. I was happy for her new journey ahead. I later found out she had already made a name for herself IRL and her story is one that really resonates with freedom on the blockchain. DYOR!
                        <br><br>
                        Like any NFT event, there's always socializing which leads into shilling then eventually connections if conversations goes there. I came out as Chipz for BlueChipz.X as well so I ordered a drink and started to mingle. I met Christiano who was light-years ahead in blockchain possibilities and evolution. He was also the main connect that made it possible for Violetta to perform on that glorious night. I met Mr. McFly whom I've met once back in 2023 when I was trying to bring food to the blockchain via PoNY and I met Stu Kwan for the 1st time along with Antonio Brasse Co-founder/CEO of BlockQuake. Stu listened to my project and went into his based on the diversity and making that global connection/reach. He summed it up with being tied to BlockQuake a cryptocurrency exchange that will soon see the light of day. I was hooked. A crypto community pushing their own coin, looking to attain a global reach via artists and already tapped in with web3 affiliates? It was a no brianer that they would prosper. He called over Antonio Brasse and we spoke a bit on BlueChipz.X and BlockQuake. His adiment towards transperency and security was profound. I admired the time and process he took to make BlockQuake a reality. He explained the relation between Quakeycoin and the exchange itself. It was clear now that BlockQuake would be a catalyst when the inevitable happends as they are two seperate entities. Say less! An unbreakable bond was made that night which only grew stronger with time. 
                        <br><br>
                        That night I also caught up with Mr. McFly who has always been known to be up to speed with any/most things blockchain related. We chilled that night and got to know each other on a more personal level. That night we went out for dinner with VTATV, LadyNeverScared and a few others whom also became fam. On the drive home I thought to myself how Mr. McFly really stayed true to his nick name "The Plug 🔌" and being active with/for community. How Quakey can take over the world in the same way I'd aspire for BlueChipz.X itself and that Stu is such a great candidate I could see standing behind for Quakey anyday. I'd incorporate Quakey to the BlueChipz.X ecosystem while aiding them on their way up which means I'd need ambassadors for my project and not just one. Who else better to elect than Stu himself and Mr. McFly -the plug? I ended up doing just that.
                        <br><br>
                        My approach to everything changed after that. I was now Quakey but also BlueChipz.X. where and how do I make a distinction whenever stepping outside or evolving? The answer was easy, to become one in the same. What we want to do is similar in terms of global reach, I choose not to have an official coin for my project which now Quakey can be. I'll make my ecosystem a Quakey Nation and add The Blockchain Marathon (TBM) for a new name to solidify my standings with them. In time, the rest will be history. LFGR0O0W!

                    I gave you the raw version of me, my thought process, of who I am and what I intend the project to become. Nothing altered, nothing AI doctored because this is as doxed as it gets here. I've been on this journey since 2022 without a road map and my followers/community has still stuck by my side. I've helped those that I can along the way. Sometimes even sacrificing my needs above their own. Please understand that making it in life doesn't mean that one has to be wealthy or rich. I'm a regular person holding down an IRL job just like most of you. I just make it look good I guess. A key difference is that I've been fortunate to love my career kept jobs, no matter the extra time and effort I put into it. With that said, if any would love to join this celestial journey on the Blockchain, my doors are open for buisness.

                    Looking back at life's prosperity and my journey on the Blockchain, I've come to realize how fortunate the universe has been to me despite everything in life. It makes me want to push even harder to see those around me win. They dedicate time and selfless service to make other peoples' dreams realities. They work relentlessly towards financial freedom while looking for a way to survive the obstacles life dishes out in the process. I'm already half way there, so of course they deserve to see financial freedom before I embark on it and I'll do my best to get them there as we grow together. So much talent, so much possibilities. If one makes it, we're all one step closer together and can create a stronger support system on the way up. That's the intent as my outreach grows to it's interplanetary intent.

                    They say that some people are born with a silver soon in their mouth. Often reflected upon being born into wealth or a stature of such. I'm here to encourage you to think deeper beyond the mind clouding money and understand the things money can't buy. Love, nurture, care, understanding, morals, wisdom. If you grew up receiving all this with a somewhat decent education, then like myself, you too can be considered as with that silver spoon and use it to help feed the world. In this ecosystem, our golden spoon represents prosperity of like minded people coming together as we also embark into food on the Blockchain. We'll use donated/funds to build BlueChipz.X. TBM into the self sufficient ecosystem it will inevitably become.
