                        I gave you the raw version of me, my thought process, of who I am and what I intend the project to become. Nothing altered, nothing AI doctored because this is as doxed as it gets here. I've been on this journey since 2022 without a road map and my followers/community has still stuck by my side. I've helped those that I can along the way. Sometimes even sacrificing my needs above their own. Please understand that making it in life doesn't mean that one has to be wealthy or rich. I'm a regular person holding down an IRL job just like most of you. I just make it look good I guess. A key difference is that I've been fortunate to love my career kept jobs, no matter the extra time and effort I put into it. With that said, if any would love to join this celestial journey on the Blockchain, my doors are open for buisness.

                        Looking back at life's prosperity and my journey on the Blockchain, I've come to realize how fortunate the universe has been to me despite everything in life. It makes me want to push even harder to see those around me win. They dedicate time and selfless service to make other peoples' dreams realities. They work relentlessly towards financial freedom while looking for a way to survive the obstacles life dishes out in the process. I'm already half way there, so of course they deserve to see financial freedom before I embark on it and I'll do my best to get them there as we grow together. So much talent, so much possibilities. If one makes it, we're all one step closer together and can create a stronger support system on the way up. That's the intent as my outreach grows to it's interplanetary state.
                        <br><br>
                        They say that some people are born with a silver soon in their mouth. Often reflected upon being born into wealth or a stature of such. I'm here to encourage you to think deeper beyond the mind clouding money and understand the things money can't buy. Love, nurture, care, understanding, morals, wisdom. If you grew up receiving all this with a somewhat decent education, then like myself, you too can be considered as with that silver spoon and use it to help feed the world. In this ecosystem, our golden spoon represents prosperity of like minded people coming together as we also embark into food on the Blockchain. We'll use donated/funds to build BlueChipz.X. TBM into the self sufficient ecosystem it will inevitably become.
